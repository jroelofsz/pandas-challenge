    "<h1>PyCity Schools Analysis</h1>\n",
    "<p>This analysis looked at how school size, type, and budget affect student success in math and reading.</p>\n",
    "<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>Students in big schools don’t do as well in math and reading compared to those in smaller schools. Big schools might struggle because it’s harder to give individual attention to so many students.</li>\n",
    "        <li>Students in charter schools generally do better in math and reading than those in district schools. Charter schools seem to be better at helping students succeed.</li>\n",
    "        <li>Charter schools get better results with less money. The top five best-performing schools spend less than $1.4 million, while the five worst-performing schools spend more than $1.8 million. This means charter schools might use their money more efficiently.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<h3>Conclusion:</h3>\n",
    "    <p>Small schools and charter schools tend to have better student performance. Charter schools are especially good at getting results with less money.</p>\n",
